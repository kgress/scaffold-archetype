# Scaffold Archetype
Scaffold Archetype is a maven archetype meant for the purpose of creating new Scaffold projects quickly and easily. It uses 
`maven-archetype-plugin` and `maven-resources-plugin` 3.x to build a new project's directory structure , from `archtype-metadata.xml` 
in `src/main/resources/META-INF/maven`, and create all required files for a Scaffold project based on templates included 
in `src/main/resources/archetype-resources`.
